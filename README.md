# grocery-list

this is my path how I have created grocery list webpage that me and my girlfriend will use. But anyone else is also welcome.

I wanted to try LAMP fullstack, so this is my project.

If you will have any commants or improvements on this, do not hesitate to create branch, make changes and make push request.

# register

first thing to do is to get some hosting. My choise is https://www.freewebhostingarea.com/ because they provide free hositng for entire stack on one place.

# setup

I am fan of L*nux and running Manjaro. Therefore I already have ftp command installed.
